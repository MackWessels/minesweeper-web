## Why this project?

I built this project to:

- Improve my skills in React and frontend component design
- Practice clean state management and recursive logic
- Create a fun, nostalgic game that looks modern and works smoothly

## How to Play

1. Click tiles to reveal them.
2. Avoid mines (bomb tiles).
3. Right-click (or long-tap on mobile) to place or remove flags.
4. Clear all safe tiles to win and see "Success!"
